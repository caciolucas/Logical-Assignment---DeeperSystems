A small task applied as a test by Deeper Systems.

The *main.py* script checks the message log from an original JSON and generates a new JSON file for each message sender. The created JSON files use the *timestamp* of one of the messages (in this case, the first) as the key, and include all other messages sent by the same sender within a 2-minute interval.
